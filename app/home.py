    My name is **Bryan Galindo**. I'm a ex-Software Engineer at Bank of America. For the capstone project, I've partnered with a small business called [Vinty](https://getvinty.com), which specializes in reselling second-hand luxury handbags. 

    After a couple of conversations with the business owner, here's the business problem I'm trying to solve.

    **Vinty** wants to **identify current trends in the second-hand luxury handbag resale market** to help guide their procurement department on which bags to purchase to **minimize their average product time to sell** and ultimately **increase their sales volume**. 

    To identify the trends, Vinty needs at least **daily snapshots** of all the handbags that are for sale on the market, along with prior sold handbag data (if available).
