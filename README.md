# ðŸ“ˆ Big Bag Data: Data-Driven Insights for Luxury Resale

My name is Bryan Galindo. I'm a former Software Engineer at Bank of America. For the capstone project, I've paired up a small business called [Vinty](https://getvinty.com), which specializes in reselling second-hand luxury handbags.

Please visit [bigbagdata.com](https://bigbagdata.com/) to find a presentation on the project.
